#+title: Miscellaneous

* Purpose:
My GitHub account started to become too crowded with my old projects I was
working on while I was a teenager.


The code is old, ugly, & mostly useless; so I decided to merge it all into one
repository that would host my old starter work.

** File Structure
Each directory used to be its own repository which has been deleted since then.
